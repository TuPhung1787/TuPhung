    <h2>Banoffee Pie</h2>
    <h3>Origin: United Kingdom</h3>

    <p>
      Banoffee pie is a pie with caramel, bananas, and cream.  You
      can make the caramel by boiling a can of condensed milk.  The
      name comes from a combination of "banana" and "toffee", which
      is similar to caramel.
